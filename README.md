git@github.com:markh126/INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT-sorting-hat.git

USER INFO
- Ideal user for this is an instructor. 
- Great for someone who wants to see what Hogwarts house they would be sorted into!

FEATURES
- When a new student is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of students that then prints to the DOM.
- Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
- Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently   from Hogwarts students.
